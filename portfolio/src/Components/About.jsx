            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I started my career in graphic design by gaining my Bachelors degree from Cabrini University. I soon found however that I had a passion for coding and building websites. To follow this newfound interest I obtained a Masters of Science Degree in Instructionl Systems and Technology. I soon found roles showcasing my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked for Verizon as a Graphic Designer, SuperMedia as SPEC Artist/Mobile Web Support, Vanguard as a UI/UX Interaction Designer/Front End Developer and currently as a Front End Developer for Nutrisystem.</p>
            <p>As mentioned I have a passion for web development. This passion makes me look forward everyday to creating, building and learning something new. </p>
