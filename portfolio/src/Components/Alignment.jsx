                       <p className="mb-2">In practical terms, this means:</p>

                        <li>Reviewing information against established criteria</li>
                        <li>Identifying potential risk, issues, or inconsistencies</li>
                        <li>Following documented rules, standards, and approval processes</li>
                        <li>Maintaining clear and accurate documentation</li>
                        <li>Working with others to resolve issues that affect outcomes</li>
